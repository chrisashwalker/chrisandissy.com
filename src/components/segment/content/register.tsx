                    We both really appreciate your attendance to our wedding. We know many of you are travelling a long way – even from outside the country, and so you joining us on our special day is the best gift you can give us. <br />
                    However, if you would like to make a contribution in some way, we are currently saving for our first house together and for a honeymoon. <br />
                    Alternatively, if you’d like to pop a fiver behind the bar that would be much appreciated! <br />
